		<h1>Welcome to the homepage of my very own website!</h1>
		<p>If you're interested in seeing what I learned, then go through each of my pages and check back often! I will try to regularly add at least 1 improvement every few days. from funtionality, to styling. below is a list of links to 
			other pages that will beter organize what I add!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Home</li>
			<li><a href="page2.html">page 2</a></li>
			<li><a href="page3.html">page 3</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Information about the website:</h2>
		<p>This website will serve a few purposes.</P>
		<ul>
			<li>Document my progress with web development</li>
			<li>Be a fun extra curricular project to work on for me personally for gaining experience typing code in different languages and IDEs</li>
			<li>Eventually, this website will be used to showcase growth and skill to potential employers once I am done with school, similar to my github repositories with my school related content</li>
		</ul>
		<button onClick="alertButton()">How many developers does it take to screw in a lighbulb?</button>
		<p>The website will not provide much value to the general public, as stated previously this is mainly just for me to have fun and teach myself programming that isn't included in my schooling with the addition of having a website on a resume!</p>




		
		<p>Some useful sites i used for research are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp">Common reference for html programming</a></li>
		</ul>
