        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a tech industry professional who has recently made his introductry role as a servicenow Technical consultant with CDW trained by Collabera. My educational background consists of an A.A degree from my local Hillsborough county community college, and then a B.S in Computer science from Southern New Hampshire University. My professional background consists of a few jobs; My first job was at 17. I worked as a certified veterinary assistant and although my title was Kennel Technician, i also managed the kennel for the veterinary practice. This included the following activities: Assisting the veterinarian during simple surgeries like spays and neuters, going along to housecalls with the vet, setting post surgical care routines for recovering animals, managing other kennel staff, etc. My second job lasted the next 5 years as a walmart associate. I had 2 job titles during my time with walmart: Ecommerce personal shopper, and Walmart+ InHome delivery driver. The personal shopper role had me searching the store for items while being timed and tracked fro performance as well as dispensing orders to customers for curbside pickup and all the processes in between. Later, my store specifically deployed a new machine that walmart had developed that would bring the items to me to pick. As an InHome driver, I was the single POC for my customers to walmart most of the time. 1 on 1 with the customer i would deliver their items inside, answer questions, and generally manage a personal and professional connection that made the customers feel safe and satisfied with my work. Finally , I am receiving training and working towards becoming a servicenoe technical consultant for a fortune 200 company, CDW.

Our task was to render a 3d scene from anywhere in our home that included, 4 objects of different complexities/count of polygons and at least 2 planes. Using trigonometric functions, i had to draw all the objects in a 3 dimensional space, apply/map/wrap the image shaders to the objects properly and create 1 or 2 light sources. I used open stacks and reddit to figure out how to integrate the different poly structures like cylinders, placed all the pieces using a single drawing function for each basic polygon and transformed in the space to condense code and improve my application's efficiency and maintinability.readability.</p>
